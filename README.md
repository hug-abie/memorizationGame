# memorizationGame
For this project, our goal is to build a game app to improve the user’s memorization ability. Our app will be able to store various colors and shapes, and as the game starts, the system will randomly show one or more colored shapes. The user needs to memorize the color and shape and later select the correct one from the given options. We’ll include timing as one of our features since it’s directly related to the user’s final result. As the user progresses, the difficulty level of the game will gradually increase. The other feature would be the recording of the highest score achieved.
